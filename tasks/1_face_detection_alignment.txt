Task 1: Enhanced Face Detection and Alignment

Description:
Improve the accuracy and reliability of face detection and alignment in passport photos.

Subtasks:

1.1 Research and Select Face Detection Library
- Evaluate existing face detection libraries (TensorFlow.js, face-api.js, etc.)
- Compare accuracy, performance, and browser compatibility
- Select the most suitable library for our needs
- Document the selection criteria and decision rationale

1.2 Implement Multi-Face Detection
- Add support for detecting multiple faces in a single image
- Implement face size validation
- Add face position validation (centered, proper distance from edges)
- Create visual feedback for detected faces

1.3 Implement Face Alignment
- Add automatic face alignment based on eye position
- Implement rotation correction
- Add tilt detection and correction
- Create visual guides for proper alignment

1.4 Add Face Size Validation
- Implement minimum and maximum face size requirements
- Add distance-to-camera estimation
- Create visual feedback for proper face size
- Add automatic resizing suggestions

Deliverables:
- Working face detection implementation
- Face alignment system
- Size validation system
- Visual feedback components
- Documentation of the implementation

Dependencies:
- Selected face detection library
- Canvas manipulation utilities
- Image processing utilities
